# Verification Agent (The Gatekeeper)

## 🛡️ Secure Identity Verification
The Verification Agent ensures that every applicant is legitimate. It acts as the first line of defense against fraud.

### 🚀 Key Capabilities
*   **KYC Validation**: Simulates real-time checks against NSDL/UIDAI (Mock implementations ready for API switching).
*   **Identity Cross-Check**: Validates that the name on the ID card matches the name on the application.

### ⚡ Performance
*   **Speed**: < 200ms response time for API validations.
*   **Security**: Minimal data retention to ensure privacy compliance.

### 🔮 Future Developments
1.  **Live Video KYC**: WebRTC integration for agent-assisted video verification.
2.  **Liveness Detection**: AI models to detect if a selfie is real or a spoof/photo-of-a-photo.
3.  **OTP 2FA**: Integration with **Twilio/Firebase** for SMS-based phone number verification (High Priority).
